## File Structure

```
Task5/
├── index.html       # Main HTML structure
├── script.js        # JavaScript functionality and logic
├── style.css        # Styling and animations
└── README.md        # This file
```

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Type a task in the input field
3. Click "Add Task" or press Enter to add the task
4. Use the filter buttons to view different task statuses
5. Check off tasks to mark them as completed
6. Click "Clear Completed" to remove finished tasks

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Styling with gradients, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Object-oriented programming with the TodoApp class

## How It Works

The app uses a `TodoApp` class to manage all functionality:

- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist between sessions
- **Dynamic Rendering**: The list updates automatically when tasks are added, completed, or deleted
- **Filter System**: Filter buttons dynamically show/hide tasks based on their status

## Browser Support

Works on all modern browsers that support:
- ES6 JavaScript
- Local Storage API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
